# 🎉 Welcome to the Fun Calculator! 🎉 
# We're going to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers like a boss! 😎 
 
# Step 1: Ask the user to input the first number 
# We're using 'float()' to make sure our numbers can have decimals too. Fancy, right? ✨ 
num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: ")) 
 
# Step 2: Ask the user to input the second number 
# Same trick here—using 'float()' for decimal magic! 🧙‍♂️ 
num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: ")) 
 
# Step 3: Time to do some math! 🧠 Let's compute the sum, difference, product, and quotient. 
 
# Add the two numbers (Yay! Addition is the first step to fun!) ➕ 
sum_result = num1 + num2 
 
# Subtract the second number from the first (Negative vibes, but necessary! 😜) ➖ 
difference_result = num1 - num2 
 
# Multiply the two numbers (More bang for your buck! 💥) ✖️ 
product_result = num1 * num2 
 
# Divide the first number by the second (Be careful with zero here, no math disasters! 😅) ➗ 
# We'll assume the user is being responsible and not dividing by zero for now! 
quotient_result = num1 / num2 
 
# Step 4: Show the user what we got! 🥳 Time for the big reveal! 🎉 
print(f"Results of your two numbers:") 
print(f"Sum: {sum_result}")  # ➕ 
print(f"Difference: {difference_result}")  # ➖ 
print(f"Product: {product_result}")  # ✖️ 
print(f"Quotient: {quotient_result}")  # ➗ 
 
# 🏁 And that's it! You've just made a mini-calculator! 😎💻
